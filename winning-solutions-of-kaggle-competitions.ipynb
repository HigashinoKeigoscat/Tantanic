    "### Winning solutions of kaggle competitions: ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally at the end of every Kaggle competition, winners and other toppers used to share their solutions in the discussion forums. But it is a tedious task to search for the competitions and then for the solutions of these competitions when we need them. I always wanted to get the links to the solutions of all past Kaggle competitions at one place. I thought it would be a very good reference point many a times. Thanks to Kaggle team for the Meta Kaggle dataset, now I am able to get them in one single place through this notebook .\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks a lot to [@sban](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb) for this [wonderful kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/data-science-glossary-on-kaggle/notebook) without which I wouldn't have got this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have inlcuded only \"Featured\" & \"Research\" competitions and the competitions are ordered based on recency. The solutions are ordered based on the number of upvotes received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have fun and Happy Kaggling.! \n",
    "\n",
    "P.S : There are few outlier discussions (which are not actually solutions) too ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "In case if you find any of the solutions missing, please post them on the comments section with links. I will add them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to notebook scheduler functionality by Kaggle, the script will automatically run once every month and update the results.\n"
